One of the main functions of an operating system is to handle device drivers. Device driver's essentially tell the OS how to intereact with any hardware connected to your computer. Without device drivers your computer would not be able to properly connect and interact with your connected hardware. 

Another imprtant function of your OS is it's user interface or UI. A UI basically manages how a user enters and receives, or displays, information on screen. the most common way a user interacts with the UI is through a graphical user interface, or GUI, which is a more visually apealing way of entering and reciveing data. 

Another crucial function of an OS is to have System Utilities. Theses Systems Utilites help provide basic communication with system files. For example a user needs to use system utilites like copy and past for file management.
